## Exercises of 3.2 Open and Closed Sets

> **Exercise 3.2.1.** (a) Where in the proof of Theorem 3.2 .3 part (ii) does the assumption that the collection of open sets be finite get used?
> (b) Give an example of a countable collection of open sets $\left\{O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3}, \ldots\right\}$ whose intersection $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} O_{n}$ is closed, not empty and not all of $\mathbf{R}$.

**Proof.**

(a) We cannot always take minimums of infinite sets. Therefore the step where we let $\epsilon=\min\{\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, \cdots, \epsilon_N\} \gt 0$ requires that we are working with a finite collection of open sets. 

(b) Let $O_n = (-\frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n})$ , then $\cap_{n=1}^{\infty} O_n = \{0\}$, which is closed, not empty and not all of $\mathbf{R}$.



> **Exercise 3.2.2.â€‹** Let
> $$
> A=\left\{(-1)^{n}+\frac{2}{n}: n=1,2,3, \ldots\right\} \quad \text { and } \quad B=\{x \in \mathbf{Q}: 0<x<1\}
> $$
> Answer the following questions for each set:
> (a) What are the limit points?
> (b) Is the set open? Closed?
> (c) Does the set contain any isolated points?
> (d) Find the closure of the set.

**Proof.**

(a) The set of limit points of $A$ is $\{-1, 1\}$, and $[0, 1]$ for $B$.

(b) $A$ is neither open nor closed, $B$ is neither open nor closed.

(c) All points points contained $A$ except 1 are isolated points and all points of $B$ are not isolated points.

(d) $\bar{A} = A \cup \{1, -1\}$, $\bar{B}= [0, 1]$.



> **Exercise 3.2.3.** Decide whether the following sets are open, closed, or neither. If a set is not open, find a point in the set for which there is no $\epsilon$ -neighborhood contained in the set. If a set is not closed, find a limit point that is not contained in the set.
> (a) Q.
> (b) $\mathbf{N}$.
> (c) $\{x \in \mathbf{R}: x \neq 0\}$
> (d) $\left\{1+1 / 4+1 / 9+\cdots+1 / n^{2}: n \in \mathbf{N}\right\}$.
> (e) $\{1+1 / 2+1 / 3+\cdots+1 / n: n \in \mathbf{N}\}$

**Proof.**

(a)
